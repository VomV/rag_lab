Expert commentary
TheCouncilofEuroperecommended,in1973,that“inaccurateinformation”
should be corrected in the context of data compiled in electronic data banks
(Resolution on the Protection of the Privacy of Individuals vis-a-vis Electronic
Data Banks in the Private Sector). So, it is not surprising that the European
Union 2016 General Data Protection Regulation provides for a “right to
rectification”. The surprise comes from the absence of guidance regarding
the rights and responsibilities related to the exercise of that right.
A person may ask the controller to rectify “inaccurate personal data”
concerning him or her. The controller has the obligation to proceed to that
rectification “without undue delay” and free of charge (recital 59). The right
extends to complete incomplete data, a person being allowed to produce a
supplementary statement to this end. In that event, the controller can accept
or refuse the modification depending on the purposes of the processing.
The GDPR does not define what are “inaccurate” personal data, but the
Court of Justice of the European Union excludes that the right to
rectification extends to allowing a person to correct an incorrect answer to an
exam (Nowak). It does not mean that a person cannot ask to rectify an
answer or an examiner’s comment regarding the exam that does not
accurately reflect the original answer of the candidate. It can happen if, for
example, copies were mixed up and another candidate’s answers were
ascribed to the candidate concerned (Nowak).
The possibility to complete or rectify inaccurate or incomplete information
can also be invoked in the context of profiling, i.e. when a company
establishes profiles of employees or users for different reasons (advertising,
marketing, work performance, and so on). It is the case where it uses
personal data, usually through automated processing, to make decisions
concerning them or to analyze or predict their personal preferences,
behaviors or attitudes [article 4 (4) and recital 24].

A “profiled” person may use her/his right of access (article 15) to learn what
information was used to create the profile and the content of the profile
itself. The “right to rectification” would allow her/him to amend, change or
update any inaccuracies discovered (Guidelines on Automated individual
decision-making and Profiling). A person might have been included in a
category, for example, that does not correspond to her/his ability to perform
a task at work or is irrelevant to her/his health condition. The person may
challenge the accuracy of the information used and the end result, that is to
say, the profile itself (Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making
and Profiling).
