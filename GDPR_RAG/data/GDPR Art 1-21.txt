Recitals
(1) The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1)
of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data
concerning him or her.
(2) The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal
data should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their
right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of
freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the
convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural persons.
(3) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [4] seeks to harmonise the protection of
fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow of
personal data between Member States.
[4] Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281,
23.11.1995, p. 31). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1995:281:TOC
(4) The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data
is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other
fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental
rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular
the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of
thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to
an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.
(5) The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial
increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors,
including natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in the
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 3 / 5
www.gdpr-text.com/en
Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to
perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.
(6) Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal
data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both
private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue
their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology
has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within
the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the
protection of personal data.
(7) Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by
strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across
the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical certainty for
natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced.
(8) Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States
may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to
whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law.
(9) The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the
implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are
significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the
level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal
data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data
throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at
the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under
Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and
application of Directive 95/46/EC.
(10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to
flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with
regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous
application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to
the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data
for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce
national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the general
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 4 / 5
www.gdpr-text.com/en
and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific
laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member
States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (‘sensitive data’). To that
extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing
situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.
(11) Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of
the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as
well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data
and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.
(12) Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free
movement of personal data.
(13) In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to
provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and
obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of
personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory
authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free
movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro,
small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250
employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their
supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should
draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC [5].

processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to
form part of a filing system.

(15) In order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of natural persons should be technologically neutral
and should not depend on the techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing of personal data by
automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing
system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within
the scope of this Regulation.

include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such
activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for
such personal or household activities.

Recitals
(19) The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the
prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the
safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific
Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data
processed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union
legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council [7]. Member States may entrust competent
authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the
prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the
safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in
so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation.
With regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this Regulation,
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 3 / 8
www.gdpr-text.com/en
Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those
competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of
the respective Member State. When the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this
Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and
rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific
important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the
execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. This is relevant for
instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories.

Article 3.
1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a
controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not.
Recitals
(22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union
should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union.
Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements,
whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.
(14) The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence, in
relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal
persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of the legal person and the
contact details of the legal person.

55. In the light of that objective of Directive 95/46 and of the wording of Article 4(1)(a), it must be held that the processing
of personal data for the purposes of the service of a search engine such as Google Search, which is operated by an undertaking
that has its seat in a third State but has an establishment in a Member State, is carried out ‘in the context of the activities’ of
that establishment if the latter is intended to promote and sell, in that Member State, advertising space offered by the search
engine which serves to make the service offered by that engine profitable.
56. In such circumstances, the activities of the operator of the search engine and those of its establishment situated in the
Member State concerned are inextricably linked since the activities relating to the advertising space constitute the means of
rendering the search engine at issue economically profitable and that engine is, at the same time, the means enabling those
activities to be performed. (page 14)

… where an undertaking established outside the European Union has several establishments in different Member States, the
supervisory authority of a Member State is entitled to exercise the powers conferred on it by Article 28(3) of that directive
with respect to an establishment of that undertaking situated in the territory of that Member State even if, as a result of the
division of tasks within the group, first, that establishment is responsible solely for the sale of advertising space and other
marketing activities in the territory of that Member State and, second, exclusive responsibility for collecting and processing
personal data belongs, for the entire territory of the European Union, to an establishment situated in another Member State.

2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller
or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:
(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data
subjects in the Union; or
Recitals
(23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Regulation, the
processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established in the Union should be
subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of
whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data
subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering
services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or
an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the
third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a
currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or
the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or
services to data subjects in the Union.
(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.
Recitals
(24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union
should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their
behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the
behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent

place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law.

(22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor
in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself
takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable
arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal
personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.
(23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this
Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not
established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering
goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether
such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be
ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one
or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an
intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally
used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as
the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering
goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it
apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union.
(24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not
established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour
of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a
processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether
natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques
which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for
analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.
(25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a
controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State’s diplomatic mission or consular post.

Article 4.
For the purposes of this Regulation:
(1) ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an
identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;
Recitals
(26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person.
Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional
information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is
identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by
another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to
identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for
identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The
principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an
identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no
longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for
statistical or research purposes.

An individual’s search history is personal data if the individual to which it relates, is identifiable
Though IP addresses in most cases are not directly identifiable by search engines, identification can be achieved by a third
party. Internet access providers hold IP address data. Law enforcement and national security authorities can gain access to
these data and in some Member States private parties have gained access also through civil litigation. Thus, in most cases –
including cases with dynamic IP address allocation – the necessary data will be available to identify the user(s) of the IP
address.
When a cookie contains a unique user ID, this ID is clearly personal data.

– location data collected by electronic communication service providers(such as mobile telecommunication operators) in the

“account” or “profile”. Many social media services can, however, also be accessed by individuals without having registered
(i.e. without creating an account or profile). Such individuals are typically not able to make use of all of the same features or
services offered to individuals who have registered with the social media provider. Both users and non-registered individuals
may be considered “data subjects” within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR insofar as the individual is directly or indirectly
identified or identifiable.

(2) ‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of
personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making
available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;

Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 2/2010 on behavioural advertising (2010):
The behavioural advertising methods often entail the processing of personal data. This is due to various reasons:
i) behavioural advertising normally involves the collection of IP addresses and the processing of unique identifiers (through
the cookie). The use of such devices with a unique identifier allows the tracking of users of a specific computer even when
dynamic IP addresses are used. In other words, such devices enable data subjects to be ‘singled out’, even if their real
names are not known.
ii) Furthermore, the information collected in the context of behavioural advertising relates to, (i.e. is about) a person’s
characteristics or behaviour and it is used to influence that particular person. This view is further confirmed if one takes
into account the possibility for profiles to be linked at any moment with directly identifiable information provided by the data
subject, such as registration related information.
DPC (Ireland), Guidance for Organisations Accidentally in Receipt of Personal Data (2020):
An organisation, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, must be aware of the possibility of finding itself
accidentally in possession of personal data. The broad definition of ‘processing’ in Article 4(2) of the GDPR means that
opening, transmitting, deleting or simply storing personal data that you have unintentionally acquired will bring the GDPR
into play.

(3) ‘restriction of processing’ means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing
in the future;
(4) ‘profiling’ means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to
evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning
that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability,
behaviour, location or movements;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation
2016/679 (2018):
Profiling is composed of three elements:
it has to be an automated form of processing;
it has to be carried out on personal data; and
the objective of the profiling must be to evaluate personal aspects about a natural person.
Article 4(4) refers to ‘any form of automated processing’ rather than ‘solely’ automated processing (referred to in Article 22).
Profiling has to involve some form of automated processing – although human involvement does not necessarily take the
activity out of the definition.
Profiling is a procedure which may involve a series of statistical deductions. It is often used to make predictions about people,
using data from various sources to infer something about an individual, based on the qualities of others who appear
statistically similar.
The GDPR says that profiling is automated processing of personal data for evaluating personal aspects, in particular to analyse
or make predictions about individuals. The use of the word ‘evaluating’ suggests that profiling involves some form of
assessment or judgement about a person.
A simple classification of individuals based on known characteristics such as their age, sex, and height does not necessarily
lead to profiling. This will depend on the purpose of the classification. For instance, a business may wish to classify its
customers according to their age or gender for statistical purposes and to acquire an aggregated overview of its clients without
making any predictions or drawing any conclusion about an individual. In this case, the purpose is not assessing individual
characteristics and is therefore not profiling.
The GDPR is inspired by but is not identical to the definition of profiling in the Council of Europe Recommendation CM/Rec
(2010)132 (the Recommendation), as the Recommendation excludes processing that does not include inference. Nevertheless
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 5 / 18
www.gdpr-text.com/en
the Recommendation usefully explains that profiling may involve three distinct stages:
data collection;
automated analysis to identify correlations;
applying the correlation to an individual to identify characteristics of present or future behaviour.
Controllers carrying out profiling will need to ensure they meet the GDPR requirements in respect of all of the above stages.
Broadly speaking, profiling means gathering information about an individual (or group of individuals) and evaluating their
characteristics or behaviour patterns in order to place them into a certain category or group, in particular to analyse and/or
make predictions about, for example, their:
ability to perform a task;
interests; or
likely behaviour.
(5) ‘pseudonymisation’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer
be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional
information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal
data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;
Recitals
(26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person.
Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional
information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is
identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by
another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to
identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for
identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The
principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an
identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no
longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for
statistical or research purposes.
(28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers
and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudonymisation’ in this Regulation is not
intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. 
(29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation should,
whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational
measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing

attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate
the authorised persons within the same controller.

(7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means
of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its
nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;

However, the publishers’ responsibility covers the first stage, i.e. the initial part of the data processing, namely the transfer of
the IP address that takes place when individuals visit their websites. This is because the publishers facilitate such transfer and
co-determine the purposes for which it is carried out, i.e. to serve visitors with tailored adverting. In sum, for these reasons,
publishers will have some responsibility as data controllers for these actions.

(9) ‘recipient’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data
are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the
framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data
protection rules according to the purposes of the processing;
Recitals
(31) Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of their official
mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent administrative authorities, or financial market
authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive
personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State
law. The requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not
concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public
authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
(10) ‘third party’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject,
controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to
process personal data;
(11) ‘consent’ of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the
data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the
processing of personal data relating to him or her;
Recitals
(32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of
the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by
electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings
for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance
of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.
Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple
purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means,
the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided.
(33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of
data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in
keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only

(14) ‘biometric data’ means personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical,
physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification
of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data;
Guidelines & Case Law
To qualify as biometric data as defined in the GDPR, processing of raw data, such as the physical, physiological or
behavioural characteristics of a natural person, must imply a measurement of this characteristics. Since biometric data is the
result of such measurements, the GDPR states in its Article 4.14 that it is “resulting from specific technical processing
relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics”.The video footage of an individual cannot however in
itself be considered as biometric data under Article 9, if it has not been specifically technically processed in order to
contribute to the identification of an individual.
In order for it to be considered as processing of special categories of personal data (Article 9) it requires that biometric data is
processed “for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person”.
To sum up, in light of Article 4.14 and 9, three criteria must be considered:
— Nature of data: data relating to physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person,
— Means and way of processing: data “resulting from a specific technical processing”,
— Purpose of processing: data must be used for the purpose to uniquely identifying a natural person.

including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status;
Recitals
(35) Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information
relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information about the natural
person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU
of the European Parliament and of the Council [9] to that natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person
to uniquely identify the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or
bodily substance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability,
disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its source,

(16) ‘main establishment’ means:
Recitals
(36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the
decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the
Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of a
controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of
management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That
criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of
technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 12 / 18
www.gdpr-text.com/en
establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be
the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main
processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory
authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the
supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority
should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the
Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory
authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of
undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group
of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking.
(a) as regards a controller with establishments in more than one Member State, the place of its central
administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are
taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union and the latter establishment has the power to have
such decisions implemented, in which case the establishment having taken such decisions is to be considered to be
the main establishment;

ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules implemented. An
undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those
undertakings, as a group of undertakings.

(36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the
decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the
Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of a
controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of
management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That
criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of
technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main
establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be
the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main
processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory
authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the
supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority
should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the
Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory
authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of
undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group
of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking.
(a) the controller or processor is established on the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority;
(b) data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are substantially affected or likely to
be substantially affected by the processing; or
(c) a complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority;

(a) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of establishments in more than one
Member State of a controller or processor in the Union where the controller or processor is established in more
than one Member State; or
(b) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a
controller or processor in the Union but which substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects
in more than one Member State.
(24) ‘relevant and reasoned objection’ means an objection to a draft decision as to whether there is an infringement
of this Regulation, or whether envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with this

Recitals
(26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural
person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the
use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine
whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as
singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To
ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all
objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration
the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data
protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an
identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data
subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous
information, including for statistical or research purposes.
(27) This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules
regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons.
(28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and
help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of
‘pseudonymisation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection.
(29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of
pseudonymisation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller
has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this
Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject
is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same
controller.
(30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and
protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency
identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other
information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.

(31) Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of
their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent administrative
authorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should
not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the
general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent by the public
authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system
or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities should
comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
(32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and
unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such
as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when
visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or
conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her
personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all
processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes,
consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic
means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is
provided.
(33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes
at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of
scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should
have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent
allowed by the intended purpose.
(34) Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a
natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular
chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of another
element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.
(35) Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which
reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This
includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of,
health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council [9] to that
natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural person for
health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including
from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability, disease risk,

(36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the
Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another
establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the
main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective
criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as

the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and

Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller
and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member
State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be
considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the
cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State
or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory
authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a
group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main
establishment of the group of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by
another undertaking.
(37) A group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the
controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other undertakings
by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have
personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in
undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of undertakings.

Article 5.
1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
transparency’);
Recitals
(39) Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data
concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.
The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be
easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information
to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of
personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights
in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific
purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the
personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are
processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum.
Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to
ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a
periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted.
Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for
preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing.

that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without
delay (‘accuracy’);
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or

In case search engine providers retain personal data longer than 6 months, they will have to demonstrate comprehensively that
it is strictly necessary for the service.

purposes;

(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take

Payment services are always provided on a contractual basis between the payment services user and the payment services
provider.
Controllers have to assess what processing of personal data is objectively necessary to perform the contract. Justification of the
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 2 / 13
www.gdpr-text.com/en
necessity is dependent on:
the nature of the service;
the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract;
the rationale of the contract; and
the essential elements of the contract.
The controller should be able to demonstrate how the main object of the specific contract with the data subject cannot be
performed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur. Merely referencing or mentioning data
processing in a contract is not enough to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR.
(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
Recitals
(45) Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is
necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should
have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a
basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary
for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should
also be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general
conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the
controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the
personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It
should also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest
or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or,
where it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the
management of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association.
(d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
Recitals
(46) The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential
for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another
natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types
of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when
processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 3 / 13
www.gdpr-text.com/en
humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.
(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority vested in the controller;
Recitals
(115) Some third countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the processing activities of
natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions
of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are
not based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the
Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of
international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation.
Transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This may be the
case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to
which the controller is subject.
Guidelines & Case Law
EDPB, Guidelines on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (2020).
EDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020).
(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
Recitals
(47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third
party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the
controller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data
subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the
existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time
and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and
fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 4 / 13
www.gdpr-text.com/en
in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law
for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public
authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud
also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes
may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.
(48) Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest in
transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes, including the processing of clients'
or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within a group of undertakings, to an
undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected.
(49) The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and
information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events
or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted
personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities,
by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic
communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the
data controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks
and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘denial of service’ attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication
systems.

the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, and
the condition that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject whose data require protection do not take
precedence.
The CJEU also specified that in a situation of joint controllership “it is necessary that each of those controllers should pursue a
legitimate interest […] through those processing operations in order for those operations to be justified in respect of each of
them”.

The GDPR may allow for the processing of silent party data when this processing is necessary for purposes of the legitimate
interests pursued by a controller or by a third party.
A lawful basis for the processing of silent party data by PISPs and AISPs – in the context of the provision of payment services
under the PSD2 – could thus be the legitimate interest of a controller or a third party to perform the contract with the payment
service user. The necessity to process personal data of the silent party is limited and determined by the reasonable expectations
of these data subjects.
Effective and appropriate measures have to be established by all parties involved. In this respect, the controller has to establish
the necessary safeguards for the processing, including technical measures. If feasible, also encryption or other techniques must
be applied to achieve an appropriate level of security and data minimisation.
Case Law
CJEU, TK v Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, Case C-708/18 (2018).
 
Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance
of their tasks.
Recitals
(40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned
or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this
Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the
performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to
entering into a contract.
(50) The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be
allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such a case,
no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or
Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as
compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or
Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain
whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the
controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any
link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been
collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further
use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of
appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations.

Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and
proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the
controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the
application of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes
and on his or her rights including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security
by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or
threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller.
However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if
the processing is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy. 
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing
including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
(a) Union law; or
(b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in
point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the
application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by
the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to,
and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and
processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as
those for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law
shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

(41) Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by
a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However, such a
legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in
accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the ‘Court of Justice’) and the European Court of
Human Rights.

on the data subject’s consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate

order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal
data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:

Recitals
(40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data
subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or
Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to
which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or
in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
(41) Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a
legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the
Member State concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of
the European Union (the ‘Court of Justice’) and the European Court of Human Rights.
(42) Where processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the
data subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on
another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which
consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC [10] a declaration of consent pre-formulated by
the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it
should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity
of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be
regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent
without detriment.
[10] Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ L 95, 21.4.1993, p.
29). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1993:095:TOC
(43) In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing
of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in
particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the
circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate
consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case,
or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing

www.gdpr-text.com/en
consent not being necessary for such performance.
(44) Processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a
contract.
(45) Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a
specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal
obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried
out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for Union or
Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general conditions
of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the
controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to
which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure
lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the controller
performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority
or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is in the public interest to do so, including for
health purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services, by private
law, such as a professional association.
(46) The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest
which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based
on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be
manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public
interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian
purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in
particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.
(47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be
disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental
rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of
data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where
there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where
the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would
need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the
collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights
of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in
circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 10 / 13
www.gdpr-text.com/en
provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to
the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly
necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.
The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate
interest.
(48) Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a
legitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes,
including the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal
data, within a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected.
(49) The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring
network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of
confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity
and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or
accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams (CERTs),
computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and
services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller
concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks
and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘denial of service’ attacks and damage to computer and electronic
communication systems.
(50) The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected
should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were
initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is
required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the
tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing
for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be
considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law
for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain whether
a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the
controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into
account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context
in which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on
their relationship with the controller as to their further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the
intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and
intended further processing operations.

Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes
a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of
general public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the
compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular
the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including the right to object,
should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the
relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public
security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller.
However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should
be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.
(155) Member State law or collective agreements, including ‘works agreements’, may provide for specific rules on the
processing of employees' personal data in the employment context, in particular for the conditions under which
personal data in the employment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes
of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations laid down by
law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the
workplace, health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or
collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the
employment relationship.

3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data
subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.

despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is

(32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of
the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by
electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings
for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance
of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.
Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple
purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means,
the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided.

Article 8.
1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a
child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where
the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given
or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
Guidelines & Case Law
Documents
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Consent under Regulation 2016/679 (2018).
The inclusion of the wording ‘offered directly to a child’ indicates that Article 8 is intended to apply to some, not all
information society services. In this respect, if an information society service provider makes it clear to potential users that it
is only offering its service to persons aged 18 or over, and this is not undermined by other evidence (such as the content of the
site or marketing plans) then the service will not be considered to be ‘offered directly to a child’ and Article 8 will not apply.
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 (2018).
Where a data controller is targeting children[16] or is, or should be, aware that their goods/services are particularly utilised by
children (including where the controller is relying on the consent of the child)[17], it should ensure that the vocabulary, tone
and style of the language used is appropriate to and resonates with children so that the child addressee of the information
recognises that the message/ information is being directed at them.[18] A useful example of child-centred language used as an
alternative to the original legal language can be found in the “UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Child Friendly
Language”.[19]
Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below
13 years.

Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Consent under Regulation 2016/679, WP259 rev.01 (2018):
What is reasonable, both in terms of verifying that a user is old enough to provide their own consent, and in terms of verifying
that a person providing consent on behalf of a child is a holder of parental responsibility, may depend upon the risks inherent
in the processing as well as the available technology. In low-risk cases, verification of parental responsibility via email may be
sufficient. Conversely, in high-risk cases, it may be appropriate to ask for more proof, so that the controller is able to verify
and retain the information pursuant to Article 7(1) GDPR. Trusted third party verification services may offer solutions which
minimise the amount of personal data the controller has to process itself.

consent in relation to information society services
Recitals
(38) Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks,
consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific
protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating
personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered
directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of
preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child.

Article 9.
1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,
or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely
identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual
orientation shall be prohibited.
Recitals
(51) Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific
protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those personal
data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term ‘racial origin’ in this Regulation does
not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing
of photographs should not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by
the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or
authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in
this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the
application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the
public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such
processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful
processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly
provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the
processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit
the exercise of fundamental freedoms.

If a social media provider or a targeter uses observed data to categorise users as having certain religious, philosophical or

seen as processing of special category of personal data in this context. As long as the categorisation enables targeting based on
special category data, it does not matter how the category is labelled.

EDPB, Guidelines 06/2020 on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR (2020).
Financial transactions can reveal sensitive information about individual data subject, including those related to special
categories of personal data. For example, political opinions and religious beliefs may be revealed by donations made to political
parties or organisations, churches or parishes. Trade union membership may be revealed by the deduction of an annual
membership fee from a person’s bank account. Personal data concerning health may be gathered from analysing medical bills
paid by a data subject. Finally, information on certain purchases may reveal information concerning a person’s sex life or
sexual orientation.
Moreover, through the sum of financial transactions, different kinds of behavioural patterns could be revealed, including
special categories of personal data and additional services that are facilitated by account information services might rely on
profiling as defined by article 4 (4) of the GDPR. Therefore, the chances are considerable that a service provider processing
information on financial transactions of data subjects also processes special categories of personal data.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:
Recitals
(52) Derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when provided for in
Union or Member State law and subject to suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights, where it is
in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal data in the field of employment law, social protection law including
pensions and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious
threats to health. Such a derogation may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management of health-care
services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and
services in the health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes. A derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment,
exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.
(53) Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where
necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the
management of health or social care services and systems, including processing by the management and central national health
authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, management information and the general national and local supervision of
the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security,
monitoring and alert purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in
the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the
processing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular where the processing of
such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or
Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of
natural persons. Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to
the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow of personal
data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data.

(54) The processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health
without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and
freedoms of natural persons. In that context, ‘public health’ should be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the
European Parliament and of the Council [11], namely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and
disability, the determinants having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision
of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing
of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third
parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies.

(56) Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political
parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public
interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.
(a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified
purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not
be lifted by the data subject;

condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who
have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that
body without the consent of the data subjects;

EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020):
The word “manifestly” implies that there must be a high threshold for relying on this exemption.The EDPB notes that the
presence of a single element may not always be sufficient to establish that the data have been “manifestly” made public by the
data subject. In practice,a combination of the following or other elements may need to be considered for controllers to
demonstrate that the data subject has clearly manifested the intention to make the data public, and a case-by-case assessment
is needed. The following elements may be relevant to help inform this assessment:
the default settings of the social media platform (i.e. whether the data subject took a specific action to change these
default private settings into public ones); or
the nature of the social media platform (i.e. whether this platform is intrinsically linked with the idea of connecting
with close acquaintances of the data subject or creating intimate relations (such as online dating platforms), or if it is
meant to provide a wider scope of interpersonal relations, such as professional relations, or microblogging, etc… ; or
the accessibility of the page where the sensitive data is published (i.e. whether the information is publically accessible
or if, for instance, the creation of an account is necessary before accessing the information); or
the visibility of the information where the data subject is informed of the public nature of the information that they
publish (i.e. whether there is for example a continuous banner on the page, or whether the button for publishing
informs the data subject that the information will be made public…); or
if the data subject has published the sensitive data himself/herself, or whether instead the data has been published by a
third party (e.g. a photo published by a friend which reveals sensitive data) or inferred.
The EDPB notes that the presence of a single element may not always be sufficient to establish that the data have been
“manifestly” made public by the data subject. In practice,a combination of these or other elements may need to be considered

(f) processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting
in their judicial capacity;
(g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law
which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for
suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;
(h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the
working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the
management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant

Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 2/2010 on behavioural advertising (2010):
Any possible targeting of data subjects based on sensitive information opens the possibility of abuse.
Furthermore, given the sensitivity of such information and the possible awkward situations which may arise if
individuals receive advertising that reveals, for example, sexual preferences or political activity,
offering/using interest categories that would reveal sensitive data should be discouraged.
In this context, the only available legal ground that would legitimize the data processing would be explicit,
separate prior opt-in consent. The requirement for a separate, affirmative prior indication of the data
subjects’ agreement means that in no case would an opt-out consent mechanism meet the requirement of the
law. It also means that such consent could not be obtained through browser settings. To lawfully collect
and process this type of information, ad network providers would have to set up mechanisms to obtain explicit
prior consent, separate from other consent obtained for processing in general.

1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and
any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise,
transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information

appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by the data subject, the information may be provided orally,
provided that the identity of the data subject is proven by other means.
Recitals
(58) The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily
accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used. Such
information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular
relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data
subject to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such
as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where
processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand.

Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 2/2010 on behavioural advertising (2010):
The obligation to provide the necessary information and obtain data subjects’ consent ultimately lies with the entity that sends
and reads the cookie. In most cases, this is the ad network provider. When publishers are joint-controllers, for example in
those cases where they transfer directly identifiable information to ad network providers, they are also bound by the
obligation to provide information to data subjects about the data processing.
2. The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to
in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her
rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data
subject.

(59) Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation, including
mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data
and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially
where personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject
without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any
such requests.
(64) The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in the
context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to
react to potential requests.

3. The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject
without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by
two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The
controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together
with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic form means, the
information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.
4. If the controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller shall inform the data
subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking
action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.
5. Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under Articles 15
to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or
excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either:
(a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or
communication or taking the action requested; or

www.gdpr-text.com/en
(b) refuse to act on the request.
The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the
request.
6. Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the
natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of
additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.
7. The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination
with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful
overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable.
8. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of
determining the information to be presented by the icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons.

communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the
data subject
Recitals
(58) The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be
concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where
appropriate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when
addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of
actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand
whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case
of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where
processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand.
(59) Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation,
including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or

to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should be
obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to
give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests.

Information to be provided where personal data are collected from
the data subject

Article 13.
1. Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the
time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:
Recitals
(60) The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing
operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and
transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed.
Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the
personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the
personal data and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in combination
with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the
intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be machine-readable.
(a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller’s representative;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2018):
This information should allow for easy identification of the controller and preferably allow for different forms of
communications with the data controller (e.g. phone number, email, postal address etc.).
(b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (DPOs) (2017):
The contact details of the DPO should include information allowing data subjects and the supervisory authorities to reach the
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 2 / 10
www.gdpr-text.com/en
DPO in an easy way (a postal address, a dedicated telephone number, and/or a dedicated e-mail address). When appropriate,
for purposes of communications with the public, other means of communications could also be provided, for example, a
dedicated hotline, or a dedicated contact form addressed to the DPO on the organisation’s website.
Article 37(7) does not require that the published contact details should include the name of the DPO. Whilst it may be a good
practice to do so, it is for the controller or the processor and the DPO to decide whether this is necessary or helpful in the
particular circumstances.
[…]
As a matter of good practice, the WP29 also recommends that an organisation informs its employees of the name and contact
details of the DPO. For example, the name and contact details of the DPO could be published internally on organisation’s
intranet, internal telephone directory, and organisational charts.
(c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the
processing;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2018):
In addition to setting out the purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended, the relevant legal basis relied
upon under Article 6 must be specified. In the case of special categories of personal data, the relevant provision of Article 9
(and where relevant, the applicable Union or Member State law under which the data is processed) should be specified.
Where, pursuant to Article 10, personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based
on Article 6.1 is processed, where applicable the relevant Union or Member State law under which the processing is carried
out should be specified.
(d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or
by a third party;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 3 / 10
www.gdpr-text.com/en
The specific interest in question must be identified for the benefit of the data subject. As a matter of best practice, the
controller can also provide the data subject with the information from the balancing test, which must be carried out to allow
reliance on Article 6.1(f) as a lawful basis for processing, in advance of any collection of data subjects’ personal data. To
avoid information fatigue, this can be included within a layered privacy statement/ notice (see paragraph 35). In any case, the
WP29 position is that information to the data subject should make it clear that they can obtain information on the balancing
test upon request. This is essential for effective transparency where data subjects have doubts as to whether the balancing test
has been carried out fairly or they wish to file a complaint with a supervisory authority.
(e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
The term “recipient” is defined in Article 4.9 as “a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which
the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not” [emphasis added]. As such, a recipient does not have to be a
third party. Therefore, other data controllers, joint controllers and processors to whom data is transferred or disclosed are
covered by the term “recipient” and information on such recipients should be provided in addition to information on third
party recipients. The actual (named) recipients of the personal data, or the categories of recipients, must be provided. In
accordance with the principle of fairness, controllers must provide information on the recipients that is most meaningful for
data subjects. In practice, this will generally be the named recipients, so that data subjects know exactly who has their
personal data. If controllers opt to provide the categories of recipients, the information should be as specific as possible by
indicating the type of recipient (i.e. by reference to the activities it carries out), the industry, sector and sub-sector and the
location of the recipients.
(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international
organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers
referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or
suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
The relevant GDPR article permitting the transfer and the corresponding mechanism (e.g. adequacy decision under Article
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 4 / 10
www.gdpr-text.com/en
45/ binding corporate rules under Article 47/ standard data protection clauses under Article 46.2/ derogations and safeguards
under Article 49 etc.) should be specified. Information on where and how the relevant document may be accessed or obtained
should also be provided e.g. by providing a link to the mechanism used. In accordance with the principle of fairness, the
information provided on transfers to third countries should be as meaningful as possible to data subjects; this will generally
mean that the third countries be named.
2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are
obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent
processing:
Recitals
(61) The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him or her at the
time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within a reasonable period,
depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject
should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal
data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further
processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be
provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided.
(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine
that period;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
This is linked to the data minimisation requirement in Article 5.1(c) and storage limitation requirement in Article 5.1(e). The
storage period (or criteria to determine it) may be dictated by factors such as statutory requirements or industry guidelines but
should be phrased in a way that allows the data subject to assess, on the basis of his or her own situation, what the retention
period will be for specific data/ purposes. It is not sufficient for the data controller to generically state that personal data will
be kept as long as necessary for the legitimate purposes of the processing. Where relevant, the different storage periods should
be stipulated for different categories of personal data and/or different processing purposes, including where appropriate,
archiving periods.
EDPB, Guidelines on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (2020):
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 5 / 10
www.gdpr-text.com/en
Storage limitation should consider the true needs and the medical relevance (this may include epidemiology-motivated
considerations like the incubation period,etc.) and personal data should be kept only for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis.
Afterwards,as a general rule,all personal data should be erased or anonymised.
(b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data
or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data
portability;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
This information should be specific to the processing scenario and include a summary of what the right involves and how the
data subject can take steps to exercise it and any limitations on the right. […] In particular, the right to object to processing
must be explicitly brought to the data subject’s attention at the latest at the time of first communication with the data subject
and must be presented clearly and separately from any other information.64 In relation to the right to portability, see WP29
Guidelines on the right to data portability.
(c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right
to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
withdrawal;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
This information should include how consent may be withdrawn, taking into account that it should be as easy for a data
subject to withdraw consent as to give it.
(d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 6 / 10
www.gdpr-text.com/en
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
This information should explain that, in accordance with Article 77, a data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a
supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged
infringement of the GDPR.
(e) whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible
consequences of failure to provide such data;
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):
For example in an employment context, it may be a contractual requirement to provide certain information to a current or
prospective employer. Online forms should clearly identify which fields are “required”, which are not, and what will be the
consequences of not filling in the required fields.
(f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at
least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
consequences of such processing for the data subject.
Guidelines & Case Law
Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation
2016/679 (wp251rev.01) (2018):
Given the core principle of transparency underpinning the GDPR, controllers must ensure they explain clearly and simply to
individuals how the profiling or automated decision-making process works.
In particular, where the processing involves profiling-based decision making (irrespective of whether it is caught by Article 22
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
page 7 / 10
www.gdpr-text.com/en
provisions), then the fact that the processing is for the purposes of both (a) profiling and (b) making a decision based on the
profile generated, must be made clear to the data subject.
Recital 60 states that giving information about profiling is part of the controller’s transparency obligations under Article 5(1)
(a). The data subject has a right to be informed by the controller about and, in certain circumstances, a right to object to
‘profiling’, regardless of whether solely automated individual decision-making based on profiling takes place.
EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020).
3. Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the
personal data were collected, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with
information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.
4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information.

Related information Article 13. Information to be provided where
personal data are collected from the data subject
Recitals
(61) The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him
or her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source,
within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be legitimately
disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the
recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were
collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other
purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data
subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided.
(62) However, it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already
possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law or
where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate
effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in the public
interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data subjects,
the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration.
(63) A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,
and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the
processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example the
data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating
physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to know
and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where
possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in
any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing.
Where possible, the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the
data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right should not adversely affect the rights or
freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the
software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data
subject. Where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller
should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or

appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.
2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the
following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject:
(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine
that period;

personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with
information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.
5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and insofar as:
(a) the data subject already has the information;
(b) the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular
for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) or in so far as the obligation
referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the

objectives of that processing. In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the data
subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available;
(c) obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject
and which provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s legitimate interests; or
(d) where the personal data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by
Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.

Article 15.
1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal
data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the
following information:
(a) the purposes of the processing;
(b) the categories of personal data concerned;
(c) the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular
recipients in third countries or international organisations;
(d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria
used to determine that period;
(e) the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of
processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;
(f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
(g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
(h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at
least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
consequences of such processing for the data subject.
2. Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall
have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer.
3. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested
by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where the data
subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information
shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form.

Recitals
(63) A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,
and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the
processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example the
data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating
physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to know
and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where
possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in
any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing.
Where possible, the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the
data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right should not adversely affect the rights or
freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the
software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data
subject. Where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller
should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or
processing activities to which the request relates.
(64) The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in
particular in the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not retain personal data for the
sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests.

Related information Article 16. Right to rectification
Expert commentary
TheCouncilofEuroperecommended,in1973,that“inaccurateinformation”
should be corrected in the context of data compiled in electronic data banks
(Resolution on the Protection of the Privacy of Individuals vis-a-vis Electronic
Data Banks in the Private Sector). So, it is not surprising that the European
Union 2016 General Data Protection Regulation provides for a “right to
rectification”. The surprise comes from the absence of guidance regarding
the rights and responsibilities related to the exercise of that right.
A person may ask the controller to rectify “inaccurate personal data”
concerning him or her. The controller has the obligation to proceed to that
rectification “without undue delay” and free of charge (recital 59). The right
extends to complete incomplete data, a person being allowed to produce a
supplementary statement to this end. In that event, the controller can accept
or refuse the modification depending on the purposes of the processing.
The GDPR does not define what are “inaccurate” personal data, but the
Court of Justice of the European Union excludes that the right to
rectification extends to allowing a person to correct an incorrect answer to an
exam (Nowak). It does not mean that a person cannot ask to rectify an
answer or an examiner’s comment regarding the exam that does not
accurately reflect the original answer of the candidate. It can happen if, for
example, copies were mixed up and another candidate’s answers were
ascribed to the candidate concerned (Nowak).
The possibility to complete or rectify inaccurate or incomplete information
can also be invoked in the context of profiling, i.e. when a company
establishes profiles of employees or users for different reasons (advertising,
marketing, work performance, and so on). It is the case where it uses
personal data, usually through automated processing, to make decisions
concerning them or to analyze or predict their personal preferences,
behaviors or attitudes [article 4 (4) and recital 24].

A “profiled” person may use her/his right of access (article 15) to learn what
information was used to create the profile and the content of the profile
itself. The “right to rectification” would allow her/him to amend, change or
update any inaccuracies discovered (Guidelines on Automated individual
decision-making and Profiling). A person might have been included in a
category, for example, that does not correspond to her/his ability to perform
a task at work or is irrelevant to her/his health condition. The person may
challenge the accuracy of the information used and the end result, that is to
say, the profile itself (Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making
and Profiling).

Article 17.
1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or
her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay
where one of the following grounds applies:
(a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise
processed;
(b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or
point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;
(c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate
grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2);
(d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed;
(e) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to
which the controller is subject;
(f) the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in
Article 8(1).
2. Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the
personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take
reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that
the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those
personal data.
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:
(a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
(b) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the
controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing

authority vested in the controller;
(c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as
well as Article 9(3);
(d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in
accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or
seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or
(e) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

forgotten’)
Recitals
(65) A data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a ‘right to be
forgotten’ where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the
controller is subject. In particular, a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no
longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing
of personal data concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does not otherwise comply
with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given his or her consent as a child
and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such personal data, especially
on the internet. The data subject should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no
longer a child. However, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it is necessary, for
exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for the
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller,
on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
(66) To strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in
such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers which
are processing such personal data to erase any links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In doing so,
that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology and the means available to the
controller, including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data
subject's request.

Related information Article 18. Right to restriction of processing
Expert commentary
The right to restriction of processing is one of the eight rights granted by the
GDPR, but it is not the easiest one to understand at first glance. It can be
summed up as an obligation on behalf of the controller to retain data, but
they can neither be processed in any other manner nor modified.
The right is exercised in cases where there is no clear indication of whether
personal data will be deleted on a precise legal ground or when. It is
especially useful when the right to erasure (article 17) cannot be invoked
immediately, if the organization has a legal obligation to retain the data, for
example.
A person has a limited right to restrict the processing of her/his data under
four scenarios:
if the accuracy of the concerned data is challenged;
if the processing of the data was unlawful but the person opposed to
their deleting;
if the data are needed to establish, exercise or fight a legal claim; or
if a person exercised her/his right to object (article 21) but the
controller claimed “compelling legitimate” grounds for the processing.
Paragraph 2 of the provision entails the consequences of exercising one’s
right to restriction of processing. Aside from storage, the personal data
cannot be processed anymore except i) with the consent of the person
concerned; ii) in actions related to a legal claim; iii) for the protection of the
rights of other persons (recital 73); or iv) if important public interests are
involved (recital 73).
The GDPR text does not specify how to restrict the processing of personal
data in cases where a person asks to, but recital 67 suggests a non-exhaustive
list of methods to achieve that goal. The data can be moved temporarily to
another processing system, access to specific data can be restricted or data

can be temporarily unpublished from a website. Technical means must
ensure that data are not processed or changed where automated filing
systems are concerned. The restrictions should be clearly mentioned
whatever method is preferred (recital 67).
The duration of the restriction is also unclear. The European legal texts
mention that data must not be processed “for a period enabling the controller
toverify[their]accuracy”,forexample,or“pendingtheverification”whether
exists a legitimate ground overriding a person’s objection to processing. The
time during which data cannot be processed will be a question of facts or of
individual situations. One thing is clear though: a person must be informed
before the restriction of processing is lifted.

(67) Methods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the
selected data to another processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or temporarily
removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should in principle
be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing operations
and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should be clearly indicated in the
system.

Related information Article 19. Notification obligation regarding
rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing
Expert commentary
Article 19 includes a notification obligation, which should not be confused
with the specific personal data breach notification obligation (article 33). It
is a mechanism that gives full effect to other provisions of the General Data
Protection Regulation, ensuring that third parties are informed about actions
taken by the controller regarding personal data (recital 66).
After a person has exercised her/his right to rectification (article 16),
erasure (article 17) or restriction of processing (article 18), the controller
must inform all parties (“recipients”) to whom s/he has disclosed data. The
provision should be read as referring to all forms of communication of
personal data, like “disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
making available” [article 4 (2)]. The recipient identified in the text of the
provision comprises natural or legal persons, public authorities, agencies or
bodies [article 4 (9)]. They are not limited to external parties, they
encompass in-house persons, departments or services.
There is a limit to the general obligation imposed on the controller to inform
recipients: her/his responsibility ends where it proves impossible to do so or
it involves “disproportionate effort” on her/his part. Articles 14 (5) b) and 34
(3) c) of the GDPR uses the same wording (“disproportionate effort”), but
the Court of Justice of the European Union did not interpret the meaning of
the expression yet.
However, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales clarified similar
wording in the former domestic Data Protection Act 1998 [article 8(2)(a)]
before the entry into force of the GDPR. The case involved a data access
request and the “disproportionate effort” exception to refuse to comply with
the demand. The judge left it to an appreciation of facts of each particular
case to balance the effort involved in finding and supplying the information
against the potential benefit it might bring to the person requesting data
(Dawson-Damer v. Taylor Wessing LLP).

www.gdpr-text.com/en
The “disproportionate effort” exception of article 19 should not be read as a
way to get around the provisions of the GDPR. It should not be invoked, for
example, if the “disproportionate effort” results of the number of recipients
to whom the controller disclosed personal data. The burden of proving that
the request would involve “disproportionate effort” should rest on the
controller’s shoulders. S/he should demonstrate that s/he took “reasonable
steps” to inform recipients of personal data, “taking into account available
technology and the means available” (recital 66).
The controller should not be allowed to invoke inadequate information
management systems or poor practices to refuse to inform recipients, as they
can be viewed as a breach of her/his obligations under the GDPR to
implement data protection by design and by default (article 25).
The goal of the provision may be evaded nonetheless by the recipient as s/he
is formerly under no legal obligation to use the controller’s information. The
drafters of the European regulation seem to have ignored this scenario,
letting recipients decide whether or not they will give effect to the request of
the controller.
As the concerned person may ask to be informed about the identity of the
recipients, s/he may have to exercise her/his rights to rectification, erasure or
restriction of processing by contacting directly each identified recipient. It
would be a shift in the notification obligation from the controller to the data
subject, although the latter has not decided to share her/his information with
other recipients.

Expert commentary
The right to data portability is presented primarily as a way to support “user
choice, user control, and user empowerment” (Guidelines on the Right to Data
Portability), as it aims at reinforcing an individual’s control over her/his
personal information (recital 68). Data portability allows users to receive a
copy of their personal data and can be seen in that sense as an extension of
the right of access (article 15). It can also help them to switch services
without losing their data, enabling users to transfer their information from
one service to a potentially better one.
Article 20 provides for a general right to data portability, which may be
decomposed into two separate rights: i) a right to receive one’s personal data
“in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format”; and ii) a
right to transmit the received data without interference. Portability can be
invoked if the following conditions are respected:
data has been collected based on consent [article 6 (1) (a) or 9 (2) (a)
] or on a contract [article 6 (1) (b)]; and
they were processed by automated means, which excludes most
paper files (Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability).
What are the data concerned by the portability right? Article 20 says it is the
data “provided” by a person. The Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability
specifies that this word must be interpreted broadly. It recommends that data
derived from the activities of users (logs, browsing history, search activities,
location, and so on) should be treated as data “provided” by a user.
Therefore, the right covers not only the data actively and directly
volunteered by users, but also those generated by their activity while using
the application, device or service in question. The official interpretation
extends the reach of the right to data portability beyond the text of the article
itself and the legislative intent of the Council and the Parliament, some
critics say.

Data concerned by the provision are only “personal
data”,
within
the
meaning of article 4 (1), which excludes anonymous data and data that are
not related to a user (Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability). It should
also be emphasized that the right to data portability must be regarded in the
context of the General Data Protection Regulation. It concerns “personal
data” and not data in general. A playlist from a streaming service, for
example, contains the listening preferences of a user and is thus included in
the scope of the right but the songs themselves are not.
The right to data portability cannot, as a rule, affect other people’s rights
(recital 68). The guarantee aims at avoiding the processing of third parties’
personal data without a legal basis while allowing a person to exercise her/his
right to data portability. However, there are limits to this exception. If, for
example, a person requests his/her calling data, the data might includes third
parties’ information related to incoming and outgoing calls (like phone
numbers). These data should be considered for the portability right as they
also concern the person who requests the data (Guidelines on the Right to
Data Portability). One can argue that the transfer does not affect third
parties’ rights more than the initial processing, explaining the existence of
this limit to safeguarding the rights and freedoms of others.
Article 20 prescribes that data should be communicated “in a structured,
commonly used and machine-readable format”, but falls short of defining
precisely the outline of these requirements. A machine-readable format is
defined in a European directive as a format “that is structured in such a way
that software applications can easily identify, recognise and extract specific
data from it” (Directive 2013/37/EU).
“Structured” could refer to an obligation to organize the information in such
a way that it can be easily accessible to users. They should not have to dig
into the document or file provided to find the expected data. Information
should be classified or categorized systematically in a comprehensible
manner and they should be offered “in a format which supports re-use”
(Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability).
The expression “commonly used”, read in conjunction with recital 68, seems
to refer to the concept of “interoperability”. Indeed, recital 68 completes the
text of the article adding a requirement that data should be made available in
an “interoperable” format. It states that “controllers should be encouraged to
develop interoperable formats that enable data portability”, but it does not go
as far as requesting that controllers adopt or maintain technically compatible

processing systems.
Even if it was adopted as one of the eight rights guaranteed by the GDPR,
the right to data portability may be looked at first and foremost as a
regulatory tool to stimulate competition and innovation in the European
internal market. It may be potentially thought of as an economic incentive to
promote the free flow of information and competitiveness between service
providers.
The right to transmit received data to another controller depends almost
solely on innovation. Could the requirement of being able to transfer data
“without hindrance” be read as an obligation to develop such systems? The
Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability specify that “hindrance”
comprehends “legal, technical or financial obstacles” if they refrain or slow
down access, transmission or reuse of data. The Guidelines go as far as
classifying the lack of interoperability as an example of such hindrance. It
should be mentioned though that article 20 poses one condition to the
exercise of the right to transfer data: it must be technically feasible.
Data portability poses a challenge to information technology companies as
they are generally not ready technically to answer such a demand. The
technology giant companies partnered to develop new standards to make it
technically possible to transfer data from one service to another (Data
Transfer Project), but it is still in the process of being elaborated. The
European Union granted a right which can push innovation, but cannot be
fully respected in the present state of the art. Technical developments are
still in their infancy and it seems almost premature to label data portability as
a “right”.

(68) To further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal data is carried out
by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her which he
or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format, and
to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that
enable data portability. That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his
or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not apply where processing
is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against
controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It should therefore not apply where the
processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject
or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in
the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an
obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a
certain set of personal data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be
without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore,
that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations
of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning
the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for

as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data
subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.
